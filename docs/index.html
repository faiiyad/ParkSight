            <h2>Logic</h2>
            <h1>This program uses a Simple Vector Classifier to identify empty parking spots. 
                It then applies a score-based algorithm that considers the position of each parking spot, its distance from the user, 
                and the status of the spot itself as well as its adjacent spots to determine the most optimal parking location. 
                Once the best spot is identified, the system directs the user to it, 
                dynamically updating its recommendation in response to real-time video footage.</h1>
